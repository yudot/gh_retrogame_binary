This level came from playing around with the idea of manually and precisely laying down a staircase to the exit. This level is as complex as the player makes it, because if they accidently put a row across all three buttons, it becomes almost impossible. If they put it neat and near the exit. It is way to easy. A mechanic I wish I could've taken advantage of more, but it only seems to work on it's own. Maybe if I make a second one...
