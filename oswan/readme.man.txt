=======================
Gameblabla's Oswan
=======================

Gameblabla's Oswan is a Wonderswan/Wonderswan color, based on OswanJ by bird_may_nike and Oswan by Alekmaul.

It can play most, if not all Wonderswan games properly. (except some B&W games)

It used to be based on Alekmaul's Oswan port but significant modifications were done to it.

This fork is also even more accurate than upstream : 

Games are now playing at the proper speed,  

games like Klonoa and Beatmania now sound closer to real hardware.

A stripped-down version of Minizip is provided as well. 

Minizip is licensed under a 3-clause BSD license.

=================
COMPATIBILITY
=================

The only problematic games are Pocket Figher and the One Piece games : they have some graphical glitches.

Sound is far from accurate. (not even Mednafen is close to real hardware)
