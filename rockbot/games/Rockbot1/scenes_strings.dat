20XX A.D.
IN THE YEAR 20XX...
STORM RAGES IN TOKYO, WITH EVIL
FORCES CAUSING ROBOTS GO BERSEK.
IN KYOTO, PEACE LASTS,
BUT FEAR RAISES WITH
RUMORS OF A REBELLION.
FINALLY, ONE NIGHT...
BATTLE REACHES THE CITY!
A HORDE OF EVIL ROBOTS WAGE
WAR AND BRING CHAOS!!
POLICE CAN'T OFFER RESISTANCE
AND WHEN EVEN ARMY IS NEAR DEFEAT,
A TASKFORCE OF SCIENTISTS
IS FORMED TO FIND A SOLUTION!
