
Ugly and dirty helper tools

1) gendata256.exe is a simple and dumb tool written in Freebasic that reads sprite.bmp and tilefont.bmp and generates m_gfx_data.c
Copy m_gfx_data.c to the last-mission-0.6 dir and then compile

2) mision.rad is a remix of original tune from the Last Mission (made by me)

3) 1.rad is keeping just instrument data (1.ins, 2.ins) which are used as sound effects

*.bmp files are being edited with GraphicsGale Free Edition, I use it because it doesn't screw the palette up like other progs do
*.rad files are being edited with Reality Adlib Tracker 1.1a under Dosbox :)
