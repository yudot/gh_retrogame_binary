LOADING ROM FILES (.A26 or .BIN)
------------

If you want to load rom images in the virtual drive
of your emulator, you have to put your rom file (with
.zip, .bin or .a26 file extension) on your SD memory
card in the 'roms' directory. 

Then, while inside Atari 2600 emulator, just press
SELECT to enter in the emulator main menu, choose
"Load ROM" and then using the file selector choose one
game file to load in your emulator. Back to the
emulator window, your game should run automatically.

LOADING KEY MAPPING FILES
------------

For given games, the default keyboard mapping between
WIZ Keys and Atari 2600 keys, is not suitable, and
the game can't be played on WIZ2600.

To overcome the issue, you can write your own mapping
file. Using notepad for example you can edit a file
with the .kbd extension and put it in the kbd 
directory.

For the exact syntax of those mapping files, have a
look on sample files already presents in the kbd
directory (default.kbd etc ...).

After writting such keyboard mapping file, you can
load them using the main menu inside the emulator.

If the keyboard filename is the same as the rom file
(.a26) then when you load this rom file, the
corresponding keyboard file is 
automatically loaded !

You can now use the Keyboard menu and edit, load and
save your keyboard mapping files inside the emulator.
The Save option save the .kbd file in the kbd
directory using the "Game Name" as filename. The game
name is displayed on the right corner in the emulator
menu.

COMMENTS
------------

You can write your own comments for games using the
"Comment" menu.  The first line of your comments
would then be displayed in the file requester menu
while selecting the given file name (roms, keyboard,
settings).
