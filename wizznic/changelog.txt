Won't fix:
Author name must be less than 32 characters.

Minor bugs:
While a moving platform is moving (not waiting) countdown ticks only count when it is "put in" the level matrix
Level-files are searched in a linier manner:
    All levels are found:
	level0.wzp
	level1.wzp
	level2.wzp
    Only level0 is found:
	level0.wzp
	level2.wzp
	level3.wzp

Outstanding bugs:
It's not possible to move a brick off a moving platform, you have to hold down the button for a while.
Falling bricks should "magnet" a moving brick if it's close enough, instead of landing of it, and then sliding off.
